<h3>Fixes</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Changes Feed</p>

<p>Change Tracker is not using streaming JSON parser for parsing the changes feed for continuous replications.</p>

<p>Issue: #97</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST APIs</p>

<p>Saving large documents with REST often returns an HTTP error 400 due to an incorrect check stop in a method. The method checks to see if there is data to be read in the InputStream, rather than checking whether the stream is empty. </p>

<p>Issue: #95</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment support on device and in the cloud</p>

<p>Updates to documents with attachments are resending attachments even when the attachment data hasn't been updated. This causes performance issues.</p>

<p>Issue: #66</p>
</li>
</ul>
