<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Couchbase Sync Gateway is an add-on that enables Couchbase Server 2.0 and later to act as a replication endpoint for Couchbase Lite. Sync Gateway runs an HTTP listener process that provides a passive replication endpoint and uses a Couchbase Server bucket as persistent storage for all database documents.</p>
